Crash reporting, logging and analytics utilities for android

This package makes it (hopefully) a little easier to try out the various
crash report services available out there.

## Step-by-step guide


* Import the code into your project
* Add lockback-android to your project: http://tony19.github.com/logback-android/
* Have your `Application` follow this model (where `SomeReporter` and `SomeOtherReporter` are two of the available reporters in the package):

        @ReportsCrashes( 
           formKey = "",
           resToastText = R.string.crash_toast_text,
           mode = ReportingInteractionMode.TOAST,
        )
        public class MyApp extends Application {
            static public Debug debug = new Debug( 
                new SomeReporter( "specialKey" ),
                new SomeOtherReporter( "https://my.server/", "user", "password" )
            );
            @Override
            public void onCreate() {
                super.onCreate();
                debug.onCreateApp(this);
            }
        }
* Each reporter requires you to create an account to the corresponding service (or host it) and may require your to download the vendor's SDK as well. See "Reporters requirements" below.
* Test the reporting by throwing an exception from somewhere in your code:

        throw new RuntimeException( "Hey, is this working?" );
  or try sending a handled exception to the reporter:

        // ...
        catch( Exception e )
        {
            MyApp.debug.handleException( e );
        }
* If all goes according to plan, the service associated with each registered reporter should have received the crash report.
* If something doesn't seem to work, check logcat.
* Don't forget to read the comments and the vendor's docs.
* You can add as many reporters as you like, except for the ACRA-based reporters (you can only have one of those). 
  They should all work in parallel (and their exception handler should chain). If you use more than one ACRA-based reporter, 
  they'll override each other's config and the last one will win.
* To get the most of the log reporting, use Logback's logger via `Logging.getLogger` instead of Android's (see the reporters'
  code for examples). This allows you to send your logs in the crash reports (for those that support it) by loggin into a file
  without having to deal with the broken logcat permission. All log calls still go into logcat as well. It's a good idea to
  clean up the log file every once in a while (e.g., call `Logging.deleteLog` when your main activity is destroyed or stopped).
